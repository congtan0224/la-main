# la main
This is a new project of mine, "la main" is a French word, which means hand. When I try to think about why I am interested in hand, it all started from my journey of learning drawing when I was a child. Drawing hand is always the hard and tricky part for me. Each fingers are different, and they can place so many combinations. They are intertwined, intricately entangled. I always wondering, " why and how human have hands? Hands are just so important in our lifes, we use them everyday for everything. \
Here in this repository, I will record the journey of meeting different people's hands. I won't shooting the picture of someone's hand on purpose, photos should be taken naturally, so some of the photo would be just a part of a whole picture may not focus on the hand, I just crop it to focus on a the hand area.\
I choose the frame size of a one-inch ID photoï¼Œin China, everyone has many these sizes's photo, whenever you need to prepare official documents, you will have to take a photo of your half-length portrait in this one-inch size. I just think this size would be perfect for my hand photo project.\
I don't what I could find in this photos, it doesn't have any deep themes behind it, but I think, as time gose by, I would feel something when different hands presented here.
