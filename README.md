# ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ la main
This is a new project of mine, "la main" is a French word, which means hand. When I try to think about why I am interested in hand, it all started from my journey of learning drawing when I was a child. Drawing hand is always the hard and tricky part for me. Each fingers are different, and they can create so many combinations. They are intertwined, intricately entangled. Also you can read a lot from one's hand, their past, now and future. I always wondering, " why do we have hands? Why do they look like this? \
\
Here in this repository, I will record the journey of meeting different people's hands. I won't shooting the picture of someone's hand on purpose, photos will be taken naturally, so some of the photo would be just a part of a whole picture may not focus on the hand, I just crop it from my old photos to focus on the hand area.\
\
I choose the frame size of a one-inch ID photoï¼Œin China, everyone has many these sizes's photo, whenever you need to prepare official documents, you will have to take a photo of your half-length portrait in this one-inch size. I just think this size would be perfect for my hand photo project.\
\
I don't know what I could find in this photos, it doesn't have any deep themes behind it, but I think, as time gose by, I would feel something when different hands presented here. \
